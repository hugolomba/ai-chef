# Recipe Suggester with AI

This is a React project where users can input at least 3 ingredients, and based on these, an AI-powered API suggests a recipe tailored to the provided ingredients.

## Key Features & Skills Demonstrated

- **State Management:** Used Reactâ€™s `useState` to manage dynamic ingredient lists and recipe results efficiently.
- **Event Handling:** Implemented event listeners for form submissions to capture user input seamlessly.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Displayed different UI components (ingredient list, recipe) conditionally based on app state.
- **Form Handling:** Created controlled forms to collect user input, validate the number of ingredients, and handle submissions properly.
- **API Integration:** Connected to an external AI API to fetch recipe suggestions based on user input.
- **Clean, Modular Code:** Built reusable components and maintained a clear separation of concerns.
- **User Experience:** Provided instant feedback and dynamic updates to improve usability.

## What I Worked On

- Designing and implementing interactive forms with validation.
- Managing and updating state to reflect user actions in real-time.
- Integrating third-party AI API to enhance functionality.
- Ensuring smooth UX with conditional rendering and responsive feedback.
- Handling asynchronous API calls and updating UI accordingly.
